CT Scan / Radon Project

Summary
	The Radon transform computes the integral along rays through an image.
To implement this in a straightforward way, I rotated the image through different 
angles and summed along columns.  For back-projecting the Radon transform sinogram, 
I added the values of each radon transform to a blank image cumulatively, rotating 
the image each time.  Simple back-projection caused a blurred image.  Filtering 
the image took out low frequencies but left a dark image.
	The Radon transform simulates a CT Scan by simulating the parallel x-rays 
passing through a phantom.  In testing my own implementation of the Radon transform 
and back-projections, I found that one must include angles ranging from 0° to 180° 
and that more angle gives a better back-projection image.  Another finding is that 
the filter before back-projection is important to take out blurring by simple
backprojections.
